# Autonomous Delivery Agent

This repository contains an implementation of an autonomous delivery agent that
plans paths on a 2D grid with terrain costs, static obstacles, and optional
dynamic obstacles. Implemented planners:
- BFS (bfs.py)
- Uniform Cost Search / Dijkstra (ucs.py)
- A* (astar.py)
- Simulated Annealing (simulated_annealing.py)

Folders:
- maps/: example grid maps (txt)
- report/: final report and screenshots (if any)

See requirements.md for run instructions.
